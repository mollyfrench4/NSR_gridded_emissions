`NSR_shipping_model` is a repository containing the R code used to project shipping traffic along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) resulting from Russian Arctic offshore oil production in Waite et al. (submitted). 


The repository also contains code to generate gridded emissions data (netCDF files) along the NSR corresponding with the projected CO2 emissions from shipping.
